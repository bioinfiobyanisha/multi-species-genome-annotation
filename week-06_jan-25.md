## Week 6 – 25 January

## Progress Report on Genome Annotation Work

---

## Overview

This week focused on large-scale genome annotation across small ruminant species, specifically sheep and goat, using reference-based annotation transfer approaches.

---

## Sheep Genome Annotation

### Reference Preparation
- Downloaded the sheep reference genome (genomic FASTA)
- Downloaded the corresponding sheep GTF annotation file
- Used these files as the reference dataset for annotation transfer

### Annotation Results
- Successfully generated GTF/GFF3 annotation files for all sheep breeds with available chromosome-level genome assemblies
- Ensured consistency and uniformity across all generated annotation files

---

## Goat Genome Annotation

### Reference Preparation
- Downloaded the goat reference genomic FASTA file
- Downloaded the corresponding goat reference GTF annotation file

### Annotation Results
- Generated GTF/GFF3 annotation files for 10 goat breeds using the reference-based annotation workflow
- Annotation files were created systematically and organized for downstream analysis

---

## Summary
- Completed genome annotation for sheep chromosome-level assemblies
- Initiated and completed multi-breed goat genome annotation
- Prepared datasets for further comparative and downstream genomic analyses
