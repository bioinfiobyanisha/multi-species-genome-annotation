## Week 8 – 7 February

## Progress Report on Multi-Species Genome Annotation and Analysis

---

## Overview

This week focused on generating and analyzing genomic annotation data across multiple livestock species, with emphasis on gene-level comparisons and visualization.

---

## Goat Genome Annotation

- Successfully generated GTF files for different goat breeds

---

## Pig Gene Analysis

- Calculated gene counts for pig
- Identified common genes as well as species-specific genes
- Compiled all results into structured Excel files for record keeping and interpretation

---

## Visualization

- Generated an UpSet plot to visualize gene overlaps
- Identified issues with the current graph representation
- Initiated re-checking and refinement of the visualization to improve suitability and clarity

---

## Extended Analysis and Ongoing Work

- Initiated similar analysis to identify common and specific gene counts and generate appropriate visualizations for sheep and goat
- Began the process of GTF file generation for cow and buffalo datasets

---

## Summary

- Completed GTF generation for goat breeds
- Performed gene-level analysis for pig
- Compiled results into Excel datasets
- Initiated visualization refinement and extended the workflow to additional species
