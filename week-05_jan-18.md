# Week 5 – 18 January  
## Progress Report on Genome Annotation Work

## Overview
This week focused on large-scale genome annotation across multiple species,
including chicken and sheep, using reference-based annotation transfer
approaches.

---

## Chicken Genome Annotation

### Dataset Summary
- Total genomes analyzed: 50
- Chromosome-level assemblies available for: 20 chicken breeds

### Annotation Results
- Successfully generated **unique GTF/GFF3 annotation files** for all
  20 chromosome-level assembled chicken breeds
- Annotation files were created systematically and validated for consistency

---

## Sheep Genome Annotation

### Reference Preparation
- Downloaded the sheep reference genome (genomic FASTA)
- Downloaded the corresponding sheep GTF annotation file
- Used these files as the reference dataset for annotation transfer

### Annotation Results
- Generated **GTF/GFF3 annotation files for 7 sheep breeds**
  that previously lacked annotation files
- Successfully applied the same annotation workflow used for chicken genomes

---

## Current Status
✔ Annotation completed for all chromosome-level chicken breeds  
✔ GTF/GFF3 files generated for 7 sheep breeds  
✔ Multi-species annotation workflow established and validated  

---

## Ongoing Work
- Continuing the same workflow for further genome analysis
- Expanding annotation coverage across additional genomes
